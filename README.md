# Carousel Card Project

This project implements a robust and visually appealing carousel card component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The carousel allows users to cycle through a series of cards manually or automatically, showcasing information or images in an engaging way.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Smooth Transitions:** Uses CSS transitions or animations for a polished user experience.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Includes clear and accessible navigation controls (buttons) and supports swipe gestures (if implemented).
* **Customizable Styling:** Allows for easy customization of colors, fonts, and overall appearance.
* **Auto-Scrolling:** Automatically cycles through cards at a configurable interval.
* **Manual Scrolling:** Allows users to navigate cards using buttons or potentially swipe gestures.
* **Accessibility:** Adheres to accessibility best practices for keyboard navigation and screen readers where possible.
* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to prevent unexpected crashes or behavior.


## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the structure of the carousel.
* **CSS:** Styles the carousel and its components. Includes use of CSS transitions/animations for smooth visual effects.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the logic for transitioning between cards, auto-scrolling, and manual navigation (buttons and/or swipe gestures).


## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/zaikanghel/Carousel-Cards.git`.
2. **Open `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  You should see the carousel displaying the cards.  Buttons will allow you to manually control the carousel, and the auto-scrolling feature should be active (you can adjust the speed in the JavaScript code if needed).
